<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Axe-core is an open-source accessibility testing engine developed by Deque Systems. This engine is the underlying
  technology for many other accessibility testing tools. This includes plugins for browser testing like
  @axe-core/playwright, @axe-core/webdriverio and cypress-axe. However, also jest-axe for unittesting, Storybook
  accessibility in the design phase and Chrome Lighthouse are based on Axe-core. <br />
  Axe-core scans HTML and reports issues found regarding web accessibility based on various standards and guidelines,
  including WCAG. In addition, it reports potential issues that need manual validation. It can be used in various phases
  of development like component testing, automated E2E testing and manual testing.<br />
</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Proven technology:</strong> Issues reported by axe-core are reliable and the ruleset is maintained by a team
    of accessibility experts.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Versatile:</strong> Axe-core can be integrated into various development and testing workflows, including
    CI/CD pipelines.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Documentation:</strong> Axe-core has extensive documentation on accessibility violations, the various
    rulesets and implementation suggestions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Extensive data:</strong> There is a large amount of raw data reported when used as a library. For reporting
    purposes it may require extra work.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Configuration and use:</strong> Axe-core is very configurable, but this can lead to complexity when setting
    it up and taking it into use, resulting in a possible false sense of conformity. Configuring an incomplete set of
    tags, missing or testing incorrect states and not following up on findings that require manual validation can lead
    to accessibility issues being overlooked.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Overreliance:</strong> Knowledge about accessibility is still required to effectively use axe-core. Some
    issues require manual validation or can not be found by automated tests.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Axe-core has proven to be a reliable tool for automated accessibility testing. It comes in the forms of a library,
  linter and browser plugin and is also the underlying technology for many other accessibility testing tools. Its
  versatility and proven ruleset make it a solid choice for integrating accessibility testing into development and
  testing workflows.<br />
  However, users should be aware of the complexity involved in configuring and using axe-core effectively. Also
  overreliance on automated testing should be avoided, as some issues require manual validation or can not be found by
  automated tests.
