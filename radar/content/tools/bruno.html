<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Bruno is an open-source tool for sending and inspecting API requests and responses. It supports common API styles such
  as REST and GraphQL and is completely free to use, with no account or subscription required. Unlike many modern API
  tools, Bruno runs entirely locally and does not rely on cloud services. Its minimal and straightforward interface
  makes it easy to send API requests quickly and work with API collections across multiple environments.
</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Local-first and privacy-friendly:</strong> Bruno runs fully locally and does not sync data to the cloud.
    This makes it suitable for security-sensitive projects where data must stay within the developer’s environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open source and free:</strong> Bruno is completely free to use and does not require an account, paid plan,
    or monthly credits.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Git-friendly:</strong> API collections are stored as plain text files, which integrates naturally with Git
    workflows and allows easy sharing, reviewing, and versioning.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited workflows:</strong> Bruno only supports basic pre-request and post-response scripts and does not
    offer advanced workflows or automation features.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Smaller community and ecosystem </strong> As a relatively new tool, Bruno currently has a smaller community,
    fewer tutorials, integrations, and third-party plugins compared to more established tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>No built-in cloud collaboration :</strong> There is no cloud sync or real-time shared workspace. Team
    collaboration relies entirely on Git and external tooling.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Bruno is a simple and efficient tool that does exactly what it is designed for: quickly sending and receiving API
  requests. Its philosophy and feature set are reminiscent of the early versions of Postman, before cloud-centric
  platforms became the norm. <br />
  It is an excellent choice for developers who prefer a lightweight, local, and Git-based workflow. For teams that
  require advanced collaboration features, automation, or cloud-based tooling, Bruno may feel limited. However, for fast
  and straightforward API testing, it offers a clean and developer-friendly experience.
