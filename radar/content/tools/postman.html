<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Postman is a tool that allows users to interact with APIs and supports widely used variants such as REST, GraphQL,
  and SOAP. Its easy-to-use interface allows just about anyone to perform tests quickly. Using the Newman CLI, Postman
  offers integration with CI/CD pipelines. It also allows for writing tests in JavaScript directly in Postman.
</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>User friendly:</strong> Regardless of technical skills, most testers should find their way in Postman very
    quickly.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Request history:</strong> Postman maintains a history of requests, which is especially useful when testing
    an API and can make the reproduction of potential issues easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Environment variables:</strong> Postman allows you to easily set and change environment variables.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Code-oriented preference:</strong> Developers usually prefer more code-oriented tools. In most cases, it
    makes sense to store API tests as close to the API source as possible and use the same language that the API is
    built in, which is usually not JavaScript.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance:</strong> Especially when dealing with very large APIs and datasets, the Postman UI can become
    less responsive.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Paid plan:</strong> Postman is not free for enterprises, and there are many other very good alternatives
    available.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Postman is a good choice for testers who need an easy-to-use interface for API testing, especially for quick manual
  validations. However, from an automation perspective, there are more efficient and scalable alternatives that
  integrate better with development workflows.<br />
  We do not recommend starting new <strong>automation</strong> projects with Postman, but if you are already using it,
  there is no immediate need to migrate.
