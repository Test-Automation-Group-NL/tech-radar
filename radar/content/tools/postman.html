<H4>Description:</H4>
<p>Postman is a tool that allows users to interact with APIs and supports the most used variants such as RESTGraphQL and
    SOAP. It's easy-to-use interface allows just about anyone to perform tests quickly. Using the Newman CLI, Postman
    does
    offer integration in CI/CD pipelines. It allows for writing tests in Javascript directly in Postman.</p>
<H4>Pros</H4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>User friendly:</strong> Regardless of technical skills, most testers should find their way in Postman
        very
        quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Request History:</strong> It maintains a history of requests, which is especially useful when testing an
        API
        and can make the reproduction of potential issues easier.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Environment Variables:</strong> Postman allows you to easily set and change environment variables.
    </li>
</ul>
<H4>Cons</H4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Developers usually prefer more code-oriented tools:</strong> In most cases, it makes sense to store API
        tests as close to the API source as possible. In that case, it might make sense to use the same language that
        the
        API is built in, which is usually not Javascript.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Performance:</strong> Especially when dealing with very large APIs and datasets, the Postman UI can
        become
        less responsive.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Paid:</strong> Postman is not free for enterprises and with many other very good alternatives around.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Postman is a good choice for testers who need an easy-to-use interface for API testing, especially for quick manual
    validations. However, from an automation perspective, there are more efficient and scalable alternatives that
    integrate better with development workflows. We do not recommend starting new <strong>automation</strong> projects
    with Postman, but if you are already using it, there is no immediate need to migrate. </p>
