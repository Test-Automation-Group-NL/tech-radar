<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Testcontainers attempt to solve complex environment configurations by providing ready-made Docker containers for
  commonly used databases, message brokers, and/or browsers. It allows you to define these dependencies as code, making
  them easier to maintain. It supports a wide range of tooling out of the box.
</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Rich tool support:</strong> Testcontainers offer over 50 commonly used databases, message brokers, and other
    tools out of the box.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Productivity:</strong> Increases productivity by offloading the complexity of managing the test environment
    to Testcontainers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Programming language support:</strong> Testcontainers support just about any programming language.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Black box:</strong> It can be slightly challenging to debug the black box nature of Testcontainers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resource intensive:</strong> Running multiple containers simultaneously can be resource-heavy, potentially
    impacting system performance during test runs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  In most cases, running tests is complicated due to having many dependencies, such as a database and/or message
  broker, or sometimes even both. Testcontainers come with almost all industry-standard tools pre-packaged in a
  container and include orchestration logic. This significantly reduces the effort required to set up and maintain
  test environments while improving reliability and reproducibility.<br />
  While debugging and resource use can pose challenges, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. We highly recommend
  adopting Testcontainers to streamline your testing workflow and simplify dependency management, especially if you're
  not already using it.
