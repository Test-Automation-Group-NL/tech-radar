<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Testcontainers attempt to solve complex environment configurations by providing ready-made Docker containers for
  commonly used databases, message brokers, and/or browsers. It allows you to define these dependencies as code, making
  them easier to maintain. It supports a wide range of tooling out of the box.
</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Rich tool support:</strong> Testcontainers offer over 50 commonly used databases, message brokers, and other
    tools out of the box.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Productivity:</strong> Increases productivity by offloading the complexity of managing the test environment
    to Testcontainers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Programming language support:</strong> Testcontainers support just about any programming language.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Black box:</strong> It can be slightly challenging to debug the black box nature of Testcontainers.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Resource intensive:</strong> Running multiple containers simultaneously can be resource-heavy, potentially
    impacting system performance during test runs.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  In most cases, running tests is complicated due to having many dependencies, such as a database and/or message
  broker, or sometimes even both. Testcontainers come with almost all industry-standard tools pre-packaged in a
  container and include orchestration logic. This significantly reduces the effort required to set up and maintain
  test environments while improving reliability and reproducibility.<br />
  While debugging and resource use can pose challenges, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. We highly recommend
  adopting Testcontainers to streamline your testing workflow and simplify dependency management
