<H4>Description:</H4>
<p>Testcontainers attempt to solve complex environment configurations by providing ready-made docker containers for
    commonly used databases, message brokers, and/or browsers. It allows you to define these dependencies as code making
    it easier to maintain. it supports a ton of tooling out of the box</p>
<H4>Pros</H4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Rich tool support:</strong> Over 50 commonly used databases, message brokers, and other tools readily
        available!
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Productivity:</strong> Can be increased by offloading the complexity of managing the test environment to
        test containers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Rich support for programming languages:</strong> Just about any language is supported.
    </li>
</ul>
<H4>Cons</H4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Black Box:</strong> Can be slightly challenging to debug the black box test containers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Resource-Intensive:</strong> Running multiple containers simultaneously can be resource-heavy,
        potentially
        impacting system performance during test runs.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>In most cases running tests is complicated due to having a lot of dependencies, such as a database and/or message
    broker or sometimes even both. TestContainers comes with almost all industry standard tools pre-packaged in a
    container and includes orchestration logic. This significantly reduces the effort required to set up and maintain
    test
    environments while improving reliability and reproducibility. While debugging and resource use can pose challenges,
    the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
<p>We highly recommend adopting TestContainers to streamline your testing workflow and simplify dependency
    managementâ€”especially if you're not already using it.
