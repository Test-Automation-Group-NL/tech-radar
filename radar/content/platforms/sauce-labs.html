<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Sauce Labs is a cloud-based platform for cross-browser and cross-device testing, offering a virtual
  browser/(real) device cloud. It has been a trusted solution in the industry for years, providing extensive browser
  and (real) device coverage with strong documentation and support.
</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Established Platform:</strong> A reliable name in the industry with a proven track record.</li>
  <li><strong>Reliable Real Device Features:</strong> While it offers fewer features for real devices compared to
    competitors, the existing features are more stable and reliable, making it a strong option for scaling large
    test suites.</li>
  <li><strong>Wide Coverage:</strong> Supports a variety of browsers and devices, making it versatile for
    compatibility testing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Delayed iOS Support:</strong> Newer iOS versions, such as iOS 16, 17, and 18, have experienced
    significant delays in adoption, limiting testers ability to validate apps against the latest simulators.</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of Performant Infrastructure:</strong> Sauce Labs struggles with delivering high-performing virtual
    environments for Safari, Android, and iOS testing, leading to slower execution times and inefficiencies in
    mobile testing workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Slow Innovation and Market Timing:</strong> While Sauce Labs is developing a more affordable alternative
    for visual testing, the pace of innovation has lagged behind competitors and new features may arrive too late
    to compete effectively in a rapidly evolving market.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Sauce Labs remains a reliable platform with strong real-device stability, making it a good choice for scaling large
  test suites. However, the lack of a high-performance infrastructure for virtual Desktop Safari, Android, and iOS
  environments, combined with the slow adoption of new iOS versions, reduces its effectiveness for modern testing needs.
  While efforts to introduce new features, such as an affordable visual testing solution, are promising, the slower pace
  of innovation may hinder its competitiveness in the current market.
  <br />
  We recommend placing Sauce Labs on hold for new projects and exploring alternatives like BrowserStack or
  LambdaTest, which offer faster support, more modern infrastructure, and competitive features for mobile and web
  testing.
