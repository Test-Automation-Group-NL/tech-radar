<H4>Description:</H4>
<p>Playwright, released in January 2020, has quickly established itself as a strong alternative to tools like Cypress.
    It supports all major browser engines (Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox), operating systems, and programming languages.
    What sets Playwright apart are its automatic waiting features, actionability checks, and web-first assertions,
    making
    it a highly reliable tool for end-to-end (E2E) testing. Playwright also supports testing on real, unmodified
    browsers,
    including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, though with some feature limitations.</p>
<H4>Pros</H4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Actionability checks:</strong> Ensure elements are actionable (e.g., visible, attached to the DOM)
        before
        interactions, significantly reducing flaky tests.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Web first assertions</strong> Automatically retries assertions until conditions are met, minimizing test
        failures due to timing issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Features for Debugging and Testing:</strong> Includes powerful tools like network interception, mocking,
        and
        tracing, giving developers granular control over their tests.
    </li>
</ul>
<H4>Cons</H4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Proprietary Protocol:</strong> Playwright uses a proprietary protocol for its enhanced features, relying
        on
        modified browser engines. While it supports real browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, features such
        as
        network interception may not work fully with these unmodified browsers. Additionally, for Safari, Playwright
        relies
        on the WebKit engine rather than testing the real, unmodified Safari browser, which may lead to minor
        inconsistencies in Safari-specific environments.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Open Source Uncertainty:</strong> While excellent for E2E testing, its support for component testing is
        not
        as mature as some alternatives.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Limited Component Testing Support:</strong> Although open to contributions, Playwright is developed and
        controlled by
        Microsoft, making its future subject to corporate decisions.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Playwright is an excellent contender for E2E style tests with its automatic waiting capabilities and web-first
    assertions as well as network interception, mocking, and tracing capabilities Its ability to support both real
    browsers (e.g., Chrome and Edge) and modified engines provides flexibility for testing needs. However, its reliance
    on
    a proprietary protocol, including the use of WebKit for Safari-like testing, introduces some limitations when aiming
    for true browser fidelity. Additionally, while Playwright is open source, its development is controlled by
    Microsoft,
    meaning its long-term future is tied to corporate priorities.</p>
<p>Despite these trade-offs, Playwright's rich feature set, reliability, and active development make it a strong
    contender for modern cross-browser automation. We strongly recommend Playwright for teams looking for a versatile
    and
    robust component testing / E2E testing framework.
