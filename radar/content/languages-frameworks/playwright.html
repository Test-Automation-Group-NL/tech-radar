<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Playwright, released in January 2020, has quickly established itself as a strong alternative to tools like Cypress.
  It supports all major browser engines (Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox), operating systems, and programming languages.
  What sets Playwright apart are its automatic waiting features, actionability checks, and web-first assertions,
  making it a highly reliable tool for end-to-end (E2E) testing.<br />
  Playwright also supports testing on real, unmodified browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, though with
  some feature limitations.
</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Actionability checks:</strong> Playwright ensures elements are actionable (e.g., visible, attached to the
    DOM) before interactions, significantly reducing flaky tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Web-first assertions:</strong> Playwright automatically retries assertions until conditions are met,
    minimizing test failures due to timing issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Debugging and testing features:</strong> Includes powerful tools like network interception,
    mocking, and tracing, giving developers granular control over their tests.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Proprietary protocol:</strong> Playwright uses a proprietary protocol for its enhanced features, relying on
    modified browser engines. While it supports real browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, features such as
    network interception may not fully work with these unmodified browsers. Additionally, for Safari, Playwright relies
    on the WebKit engine rather than testing the real, unmodified Safari browser, which may lead to minor
    inconsistencies in Safari-specific environments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open-source uncertainty:</strong> While excellent for E2E testing, Playwrightâ€™s support for component
    testing is not as mature as some alternatives.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited component testing control:</strong> Although open to contributions, Playwright is developed and
    controlled by Microsoft, making its long-term future subject to corporate decisions.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Playwright is an excellent contender for E2E-style tests with its automatic waiting capabilities, web-first
  assertions, and powerful debugging features like network interception, mocking, and tracing. Its ability to support
  both real browsers (e.g., Chrome and Edge) and modified engines provides flexibility for testing needs. However, its
  reliance on a proprietary protocol, including the use of WebKit for Safari-like testing, introduces some limitations
  when aiming for true browser fidelity. Additionally, while Playwright is open source, its development is controlled by
  Microsoft, meaning its long-term future is tied to corporate priorities.<br />
  Despite these trade-offs, Playwright's rich feature set, reliability, and active development make it a strong
  contender for modern cross-browser automation. We strongly recommend Playwright for teams looking for a versatile and
  robust component testing/E2E testing framework.
