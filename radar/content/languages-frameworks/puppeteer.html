<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Puppeteer, developed by Google, is a browser automation tool popular for Chrome and Firefox automation. While it
    provides rich tracing capabilities and WebDriver BiDi support, its limited browser support and need for additional
    tools make it less ideal for comprehensive test automation.</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Rich tracing capabilities:</strong> Provides detailed browser tracing for debugging and performance
        analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>WebDriver BiDi support:</strong> Enables advanced browser interaction features.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Limited browser support:</strong> Works primarily with Chrome for Testing and Firefox.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Requires additional tools:</strong> Needs integration with libraries like Mocha and Chai for full test
        automation functionality.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Puppeteer is a powerful tool for browser automation but falls short for modern test automation due to its limited
    browser support and reliance on external libraries. For new projects, tools like Playwright, which offer broader
    browser support and integrated features, are often a better choice.</p>
