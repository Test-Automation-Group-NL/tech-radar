<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>Selenium, first released in 2004, is the foundation of modern web automation and the driving force behind the W3C
    WebDriver standard. Its widespread adoption has helped establish industry-wide best practices for cross-browser
    automation. With support for multiple programming languages and real browser automation, Selenium remains a key tool
    in the test automation ecosystem.</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>W3C standards compliant:</strong> As the foundation of the WebDriver standard, Selenium ensures
        reliability
        and compatibility across modern browsers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cross-browser support:</strong> Works with all major browsers, making it a versatile solution for
        automation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Upcoming WebDriver BiDi support:</strong> Promises advanced interaction capabilities.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Large community and Ecosystem:</strong> Extensive resources, integrations, and an active contributor
        base
        provide strong
        long-term support.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Additional tooling required:</strong> Requires integration with other tools for reporting,
        parallelization,
        and a full automation setup.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Less intuitive:</strong> Compared to newer tools like Playwright or Cypress, Selenium's setup and API
        can be
        more complex to learn.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Selenium has been instrumental in shaping web automation standards, and its reliability and broad ecosystem continue
    to make it a viable choice for cross-browser testing. While it may not have the streamlined usability of newer
    tools,
    its adherence to industry standards and strong community support keep it relevant in many automation strategies.</p>
<p>We put Selenium on hold for starting new projects, as other tools may offer a more modern and streamlined experience
    today. However, if you are already using Selenium, we recommend evaluating BiDi support and considering it on your
    feature roadmap to assess how it could enhance your project in the future.
