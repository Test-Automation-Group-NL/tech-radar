<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Until April 2024, Cypress was the most downloaded end-to-end (E2E) testing tool according to npmtrends.com,
  showcasing its popularity. It is a commercially maintained tool with excellent free resources to get started,
  including very clear and extensive documentation. Integrating Cypress into your developer workflow is easy; it has a
  nice UI that can be opened next to the browser, making it easy to debug your code. <br />
  A great feature of Cypress is its ability to create component tests. With this feature, you can test your components
  in isolation, which can have a positive impact on the number of E2E tests needed to cover the application under test.
  Another great feature of Cypress is its ability to run tests in parallel, which can significantly speed up the test
  execution time because Cypress is able to load-balance the test run via the Cypress Cloud. This feature does not need
  a paid tier. Cypress also has a couple of other features that are great for scaling your test suite, like extended
  reporting, test replay (because debugging in CI can be hard), UI coverage, and more.
  Some of these features are only available in the paid version of Cypress, but the free tier of the Cypress Cloud is
  still very powerful. More on the pricing can be found here: <a href="https://www.cypress.io/pricing/">Cypress

  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Expensive Cloud features</strong> make it less attractive to make use a paid tier on the Cypress Cloud.
    Features like Flake Detection, Flaky Test analytics are great, but because the pricing is based on the number of
    tests run, it can be very expensive for larger test suites.
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Cypress Cloud Data Storage:</strong> The data storage of the Cypress Cloud is located in the US, which
    can be a problem for companies that are not allowed to store data outside of the EU.

</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Cypress is a great choice for teams starting their automation journey or teams who lean on more outdated test
  frameworks, offering robust free features and a beginner-friendly experience.
