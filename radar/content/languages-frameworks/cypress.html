<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Until April 2024, Cypress was the most downloaded end-to-end (E2E) testing tool according to npmtrends.com, showcasing
  its popularity. It is a commercially maintained tool with excellent free resources to get started, including very
  clear and extensive documentation. Integrating Cypress into your developer workflow is easy; it has a user-friendly UI
  that can be opened next to the browser, making it easy to debug your code.<br />
  A great feature of Cypress is its ability to create component tests. Testing components in isolation is generally more
  stable and decreases the amount of E2E tests. Cypress is able to load-balance the tests and run them in parallel via
  the Cypress Cloud, available in the free tier. Cypress also has several other features that are great for scaling your
  test suite, such as extended reporting, test replay (because debugging in CI can be hard), UI coverage, and more.<br />
  Some of these features are only available in the paid version of Cypress, but the free tier of the Cypress Cloud is
  still very powerful. More on the pricing can be found here:

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Beginner-friendly:</strong> Offers a smooth learning curve with extensive documentation, free training
    resources, and practical examples, making it easy to adopt.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Comprehensive free features:</strong> Provides everything needed for initial test automation without
    requiring payment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Integrated debugging tools:</strong> Built-in debugging capabilities simplify troubleshooting during
    development.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Load-balanced parallelism:</strong> Cypress can load-balance your tests over multiple CI runners (paid
    feature).
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Expensive cloud features:</strong> Paid Cypress Cloud features like Flake Detection and Flaky Test Analytics
    are great, but because pricing is based on the number of tests run, costs can be very high for larger test suites.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Cypress Cloud data storage:</strong> Data storage for the Cypress Cloud is located in the US, which can be a
    problem for companies that are not allowed to store data outside of the EU.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Cypress is a great choice for teams starting their automation journey or teams relying on more outdated test
  frameworks, offering robust free features and a beginner-friendly experience.
