<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
  <strong>BDD</strong> (Behavior Driven Development) is a technique intended to prove that the desired behaviour of
  the application works as part of the development cycle. Acceptance criteria are written as a test to be automated.
  This makes it one of the easier Test First Approaches.<br>
  The technique is mostly used to enable easier collaboration between developer, tester, and (business) users.
  Applying BDD focusses on creating testable user stories that require a lower cognitive load from the developer. <br>
  Most popular automation frameworks support a BDD workflow. Tools that explicitly focus on BDD include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cucumber / Reqnroll (successor of Specflow)</li>
  <li>Behave / JBehave</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>BDD allows spec-files to serve as both living documented requirements and tests.</li>
  <li>BDD drives user stories to be clearly defined because of the testable acceptance criteria.</li>
  <li>BDD focusses on reducing functional complexity for the developers, reducing cognitive load.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Doing BDD correctly is really difficult. It requires strong collaboration between developers, testers, and
    business stakeholders, which can be challenging to establish and maintain.</li>
  <li>BDD, in most projects, is often misused as merely a way to write tests in a human-readable language. Without the
    collaborative focus on shared understanding and behavior specification, it holds little value.</li>
  <li>In some projects, BDD is simplified to using Cucumber and is misinterpreted as a low-code automation solution,
    appealing to teams as a shortcut to start automating. However, BDD's purpose is not to simplify automation but
    to foster collaboration and ensure a shared understanding of the system's expected behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  While BDD is widely adopted, it is rarely done right. <br>
  In our experience, BDD is rarely applied for its intended purposeâ€”facilitating collaboration and ensuring shared
  understanding between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. Instead, it often becomes an additional layer
  of complexity, where the Gherkin syntax adds little value beyond traditional testing approaches. <br>
  Where BDD is done right, we see user stories delivered to production faster and a reduced need for other acceptance
  level tests. <br>
  We recommend BDD when it is supported by business stakeholders, developers and testers. In other circumstances it is
  a wasted effort.
