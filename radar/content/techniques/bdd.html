<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  <strong>BDD</strong> (Behavior-Driven Development) is a technique intended to prove that the desired behavior of
  the application works as part of the development cycle. Acceptance criteria are written as a test to be automated.
  This makes it one of the easier test-first approaches.<br />
  The technique is mostly used to enable easier collaboration between developers, testers, and (business) users.
  Applying BDD focuses on creating testable user stories that require a lower cognitive load from the developer.<br />
  Most popular automation frameworks support a BDD workflow. Tools that explicitly focus on BDD include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cucumber / Reqnroll (successor of SpecFlow).</li>
  <li>Behave / JBehave.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Living documentation:</strong> BDD allows spec files to serve as both living documented requirements and
    tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Clearer user stories:</strong> BDD drives user stories to be clearly defined through testable acceptance
    criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Reduced cognitive load:</strong> BDD focuses on reducing functional complexity for developers by focusing
    on behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Challenging to implement:</strong> Doing BDD correctly is difficult and requires strong collaboration
    between developers, testers, and business stakeholders, which can be challenging to establish and maintain.</li>
  <li><strong>Often misused:</strong> BDD is frequently misused as merely a way to write tests in a human-readable
    language. Without the collaborative focus on shared understanding and behavior specification, it holds little value.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Misinterpreted as low-code:</strong> In some projects, BDD is simplified to using Cucumber and
    misinterpreted as a low-code automation solution, appealing to teams as a shortcut to start automating. However,
    BDD's purpose is not to simplify automation but to foster collaboration and ensure a shared understanding of the
    system's expected behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  While BDD is widely adopted, it is rarely done right.<br />
  In our experience, BDD is rarely applied for its intended purpose, facilitating collaboration and ensuring shared
  understanding between developers, testers, and business stakeholders. Instead, it often becomes an additional layer
  of complexity, where the Gherkin syntax adds little value beyond traditional testing approaches.<br />
  Where BDD is done right, we see user stories delivered to production faster, and a reduced need for other acceptance
  level tests.<br />
  We recommend BDD when it is supported by business stakeholders, developers, and testers. In other circumstances, it is
  a wasted effort.
