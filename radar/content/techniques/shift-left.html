<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Shift Left involves moving testing activities earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), sometimes even
  before code is written. The goal is to detect and resolve bugs as early as possible, which reduces cost, accelerates
  feedback, and improves software quality.
</p>
<h4>Examples of Shift Left practices:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Early testing during analysis/design:</strong> Define test scenarios or acceptance criteria (e.g., using
    BDD/Gherkin) as part of requirements gathering.</li>
  <li><strong>Unit & integration testing:</strong> Developers write tests alongside code, catching bugs earlier and
    ensuring faster resolution.</li>
  <li><strong>Test automation:</strong> Automate tests (that add business value) to run continuously in CI/CD pipelines.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Static analysis & linting:</strong> Tools like ESLint, SonarQube, or TypeScript check code quality and
    catch errors during development.</li>
  <li><strong>Security Shift Left (DevSecOps):</strong> Apply security checks (e.g., dependency scanning, static
    security analysis) at commit or build time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Faster development cycles:</strong> Early bug detection reduces rework and shortens delivery timelines.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced collaboration:</strong> Developers, testers, and business stakeholders work closely from the
    start.</li>
  <li><strong>Increased automation & coverage:</strong> Automated tests provide rapid feedback and higher confidence in
    changes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cultural shift required:</strong> Teams need to adopt new mindsets, tools, and workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial investment:</strong> Time, tooling, and training are needed upfront.</li>
  <li><strong>Incomplete real-world coverage:</strong> Some issues may still only appear later in the process or in
    production.</li>
  <li><strong>Over-reliance on pre-release testing:</strong> Focusing too much on early-stage checks may lead to
    thinking about and or missing issues that only surface in real-world usage or production environments.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  We recommend adopting Shift Left practices to detect defects earlier and improve overall software quality. In doing
  so, we often advise teams to re-evaluate the role of slower, UI-based E2E tests in favor of faster feedback layers
  like API and unit testing. In practice, we often see that this shift has a significant impact on the overall test
  (automation) strategy, requiring thoughtful integration, ideally in combination with Shift Right practices to ensure
  quality throughout the entire software lifecycle.
