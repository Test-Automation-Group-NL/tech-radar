<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern commonly used to structure test code, typically reflecting the
  structure of the application under test. By encapsulating the logic for interacting with a page in a single
  location, POM reduces code duplication and enhances test maintainability. Typically, these page objects extend a base
  class that includes shared methods for interacting with common page elements, such as clicking buttons or filling out
  forms. However, modern test frameworks like Playwright and Cypress offer built-in functionality for interacting with
  page elements, making the need for base classes less critical.<br />
  As frameworks like React have popularized the use of UI components, test frameworks should adopt a similar approach.
  Instead of relying on base pages, consider using component objects and applying composition to your page objects.
  This approach ensures that your framework closely mirrors the system under test.

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reduced code duplication:</strong> POM helps centralize the logic for interacting with page elements in
    a single class. This minimizes code repetition, making it easier to maintain test scripts when the UI changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved test maintainability:</strong> Since the page logic is separated into different classes,
    updating the UI (e.g., changing button names or locations) only requires changes to the corresponding page
    object class, not throughout every test script.</li>
  <li><strong>Separation of concerns:</strong> POM separates the test logic (what you are testing) from the
    interaction logic (how you interact with the page), making your tests cleaner, more organized, and easier to read.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Increased complexity for small projects:</strong> For small projects, the overhead of creating and
    maintaining page objects may outweigh the benefits. In these cases, a simpler approach may be more appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependency on UI structure:</strong> If the UI changes frequently, maintaining page objects can become
    time-consuming. In these cases, consider using more flexible selectors or alternative testing strategies.</li>
  <li><strong>Over-abstraction:</strong> Overusing the POM can lead to overly complex test code, making it harder to
    understand and maintain. Be cautious of creating unnecessary levels of abstraction.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  The POM can be an effective design pattern, especially for large and complex applications. However, it's important to
  be mindful of the potential drawbacks and strike a careful balance between principles like Don't Repeat Yourself
  (DRY) and Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS). By considering these principles, POM can still be a valid and valuable choice
  for structuring your test code, as long as you apply it thoughtfully.<br />
  Alternatively, if your application primarily consists of components, you could also apply the functional helper
  pattern.
