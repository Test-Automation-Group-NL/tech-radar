<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  The web and IT applications plays an essential role in our daily lives. Therefore ensuring that digital products are
  accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is necessary. Disabilities can be temporary or more
  permanent and come in many forms, including visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Attention to
  accessibility should be part from the start of your development and testing should at least assess compliance with
  established accessibility standards, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Accessibility testing
  can be seen as a specialism just like security testing. Automated accessibility testing tools can help identify common
  issues, but can not fully substitute for both expert reviews and user testing with people with disabilities.
</p>
<h4>Examples of tools include:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Design tools</strong> like various various Design kits for Figma and Sketch like IBM Equal Access</li>
  <li><strong>Development support</strong> like various ESLint plugins, Axe DevTools linter and Axe-core</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Browser plugins</strong> like Taba11y, HeadingsMap, Axe DevTools plugin, IBM Equal Access, WCAG Colour
    contrast checker and Silktide
  </li>
  <li><strong>Automated tools</strong> like axe-core, IBM Equal Access and Guidepup</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assistive technology</strong> like screenreaders VoiceOver, NVDA and JAWS and platform / OS specific
    settings
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Early feedback:</strong> Many tools can be integrated into your development workflow, providing immediate
    feedback to designers, developers and testers during the development process.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Better for everybody:</strong> An accessible application benefits also users without disabilities, the so
    called 'curb cut effect'.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Legal compliance:</strong> Accessibility testing helps ensure compliance with legal requirements and
    standards, reducing the risk of lawsuits and penalties.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Broader audience:</strong> A significant portion of the population has some form of disability. By making
    your application accessible, you can reach a wider audience and potentially increase turnover.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Effort in existing applications:</strong> Existing applications may require significant effort to make
    accessible, especially if accessibility was not considered in earlier development.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Knowledge & expertise:</strong> Making accessible applications requires specific knowledge and expertise to
    understand how certain design and development choices impact accessibility. This may require training or consulting
    specialists.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Accessibility testing is an essential aspect of modern web development. When taking into consideration from the start,
  it does not have to take more time or effort than other quality attributes. There are many tools available to
  facilitate accessible design, development and testing. The impact on users with disabilities should not be
  underestimated as well as the proportion of people who currently or in the future will have some sort of disability.
  Accessibility should be a mindset and given the available tooling, there is no reason to at least include a part in
  your development and testing processes. However, it can take time and effort to make existing applications accessible
  and may be a learning curve. Only a part can be tested with automated tools, so (periodic) expert reviews and user
  testing with people with disabilities are essential for your manual testing efforts as well.
