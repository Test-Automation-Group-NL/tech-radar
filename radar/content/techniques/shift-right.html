<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Shift Right focuses on testing, validation, and monitoring after software has been released into production or
  near-production environments. It complements pre-release testing by using real-world feedback, usage patterns, and
  system behavior to ensure reliability and continuous improvement.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Observability Testing</strong> (using logs, metrics, and traces) is one example of Shift Right, but Shift
  Right also includes techniques like:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Canary releases:</strong> Gradually releasing features to a subset of users and monitoring their impact.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Chaos testing:</strong> Introducing controlled failures to test system resilience (e.g., with tools like
    Chaos Monkey).</li>
  <li><strong>Feature toggles & A/B testing:</strong> Controlling feature rollout and gathering user feedback before
    full deployment.</li>
  <li><strong>Service monitoring & alerting:</strong> Using dashboards, logs, and tracing to detect and respond to
    issues in real time.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-world validation:</strong> Ensures the software works as expected in actual usage conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> Live metrics and user feedback drive ongoing enhancements.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved user experience:</strong> Allows rapid detection and resolution of issues affecting users.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Risk of user impact:</strong> Bugs in production may affect real users before they are fixed.</li>
  <li><strong>Requires operational maturity:</strong> Without mature CI/CD pipelines and alerting, the benefits of Shift
    Right can be limited or delayed.</li>
  <li><strong>Dependent on usage data:</strong> Low user activity can limit the effectiveness of Shift Right strategies.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  We recommend adopting Shift Right practices to validate software in real-world conditions and drive continuous
  improvement after release. In our experience, teams that invest in observability, feature toggles, and experimentation
  gain critical insights that traditional testing cannot provide. Failures in production, when properly monitored, offer
  valuable input for improving both resilience and user experience. Shift Right requires a certain level of operational
  maturity to be effective. We advise combining it with Shift Left practices to create a balanced quality strategy
  across the full software lifecycle.
