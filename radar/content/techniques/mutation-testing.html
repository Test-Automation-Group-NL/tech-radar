<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Conceptually, mutation testing is straightforward. Using specialized tools, small changes (mutations) are made to
    the source code of an application, creating a "mutant." When tests are executed against this mutant, the expectation
    is that one or more tests will fail, indicating that the mutation introduced an incorrect system behavior. This
    process is referred to as "killing the mutant." If no tests fail, it is a clear indication that the mutated part of
    the application lacks sufficient test coverage. Mutation testing is often referred to as "testing the tests."

<p>
    Here are a few examples of mutation testing tools (not an exhaustive list):
<ul>
    <li>PIT (pitest.org)</li>
    <li>Arcmutate (arcmutate.com)</li>
    <li>Stryker Mutator (stryker-mutator.io)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ensures Test Quality:</strong> Mutation testing helps determine not just test coverage but also test
        effectiveness, ensuring your tests can detect actual faults in the code.</li>
    <li><strong>Identifies Weak Tests:</strong> It can highlight weak or redundant tests that might be passing but are
        not effectively validating the application's behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Mutation testing can be computationally expensive, especially in large projects, as it requires running the test
        suite multiple times for each mutation.</li>
    <li>It may require additional configuration or tuning to integrate seamlessly with your existing testing pipelines
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
    Mutation Testing is an amazing technique to validate if you can actually rely on your tests to inform you of changed
    behavior. Traditional test coverage (i.e. line, statement, branch, etc.) measures only which code is executed by
    your tests. It does not check that your tests are actually able to detect faults in the executed code. It is
    therefore only able to identify code that is definitely not tested.
    Mutation testing is much better, as it is actually able to detect whether each
    statement is meaningfully tested. Therefore giving an accurate report on the quality of your tests.
    <br />We would definitely recommend checking it out!
