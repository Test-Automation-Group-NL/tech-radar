<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  If your team or company has a static component library, performing visual regression tests can provide significant
  value by offering visual validation of these components on every iteration. While you could detect these differences
  manually, sometimes they are extremely small and the process can be time-consuming. Most tools offer a
  pixel-by-pixel comparison and work similarly. The challenge lies in finding a threshold that strikes the perfect
  balance between avoiding flaky tests, missing regressions, or constantly updating snapshots.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of popular visual testing tools include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Chromatic</li>
  <li>Percy</li>
  <li>Test tool implementations, e.g., Playwright, WebdriverIO</li>
  <li>Applitools</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ease of implementation:</strong> Many visual testing tools are simple to set up and integrate into
    existing workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated visual monitoring:</strong> Tools can monitor visual regressions more easily than doing so
    manually.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flakiness:</strong> Visual comparisons can result in flaky tests if thresholds are not correctly set,
    leading to time-consuming debugging tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> High-quality tools are often paid, and performing many comparisons can significantly
    increase licensing costs.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Visual regression testing can be very beneficial when implemented correctly, preventing unnoticed UI changes and
  improving overall design consistency. However, improper setup can turn it into a time sink.<br />
  For teams using Storybook, visual testing is an especially natural fit, as it enables seamless validation of UI
  components in isolation. If your project includes a well-defined, static component library, investing in visual
  regression testing is highly recommended. Otherwise, teams may find better value in other QA activities.
