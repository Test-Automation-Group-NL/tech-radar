<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
  If your team or company has a static component library, performing Visual Regression tests can provide massive value
  by providing visual validation of these components on every iteration. Obviously, you could detect these differences
  manually, but sometimes they're extremely small and it's quite time-consuming. Most tools offer a pixel-by-pixel
  comparison and work similarly. The difficulty comes with searching for a threshold that's a perfect trade-off between
  not having flaky tests, missed regressions, or having to update the snapshots all the time.

<p>
  Examples of popular visual testing tools are
<ul>
  <li>Chromatic</li>
  <li>Percy</li>
  <li>Test tool implementations, e.g. Playwright, WebdriverIO</li>
  <li>Applitools</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ease of Implementation:</strong> Many visual testing tools are simple to set up and integrate into
    existing workflows.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated Visual Monitoring:</strong> By using tools, you can monitor visual regression more easily than
    by doing it manually</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flakiness:</strong> Visual comparisons can result in flaky tests if thresholds are not correctly set
    leading to time-consuming debugging tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> High quality tools are often paid and doing a lot of comparisons could increase the
    licensing costs a lot.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Visual Regression Testing can be very beneficial when implemented correctly, preventing unnoticed UI changes and
  improving overall design consistency. However, improper setup can turn it into a time sink.<br />
  For teams using Storybook, visual testing is an especially natural fit, as it enables seamless validation of UI
  components in isolation. If your project includes a well-defined, static component library, investing in visual
  regression testing is highly recommended. Otherwise, teams may find better value in other QA activities.
