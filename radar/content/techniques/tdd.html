<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  <strong>TDD</strong>, or Test-Driven Development, is a practice used in software development to create high-quality,
  neat, and error-free code, especially when change is likely to happen later on. As the name suggests, TDD is a
  development approach driven by tests rather than first writing your code and adding unit tests afterward.
</p>

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Test coverage:</strong> By writing tests before you code, you know all your written code is covered by
    unit tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Quality:</strong> The quality of your code will improve because you need to think about scenarios and
    functionality before you write a single line of code.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Learning curve:</strong> It can be difficult to start with TDD; it takes time and effort to invest in this
    technique.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  TDD can dramatically improve the quality of your code as it forces you to think about tests before writing
  code and gives you rapid feedback when making changes.<br />
  We recommend evaluating if TDD fits within the context of your organization, e.g., if your product is relatively
  well-defined and doesn't change in extreme forms very rapidly.
