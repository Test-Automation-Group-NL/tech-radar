<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Component testing focuses on verifying the functionality of individual components or modules in isolation,
    independent of the overall system. This approach is particularly effective in modern, modular development practices,
    such as those using frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. By isolating components, developers can ensure that each
    part behaves as expected, enabling faster and more reliable integration into larger systems.
</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Proven Effectiveness:</strong> Ensures each component functions correctly, reducing bugs during
        integration.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast Feedback Loop:</strong> Quickly detects issues, enabling rapid fixes during development.</li>
    <li><strong>Improved Debugging:</strong> Failures are scoped to the individual component, simplifying root-cause
        analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Requires Complementary Testing:</strong> Must be supplemented with integration and end-to-end tests to
        ensure system-wide functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Setup Overhead:</strong> Requires tools and mocks for setup, though this effort pays off in the
        long term.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Context:</strong> Testing in isolation might miss issues caused by component interactions.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Component testing is a proven practice that delivers significant value, especially in projects using modular
    architectures. However, it should complement, not replace, unit testing (UT). Each layer of testing has its own
    purpose, and overlapping coverage between unit and component tests should be avoided to prevent redundancy.
    Additionally, component testing can be effectively combined with visual testing to verify both behavior and UI
    consistency. We strongly recommend adopting component testing for immediate use wherever it fits project
    requirements, as part of a comprehensive and efficient testing strategy.</p>
