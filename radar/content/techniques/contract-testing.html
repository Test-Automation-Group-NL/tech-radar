<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
  Contract testing is a methodology for ensuring that two separate systems (such as two microservices) are compatible
  and can communicate with one another. It captures the interactions that are exchanged between each service, storing
  them in a contract, which can then be used to verify that both parties adhere to it. Contract testing goes beyond
  schema testing, requiring both parties to come to a consensus on the allowed set of interactions and allowing for
  evolution over time.<br />
  What sets this form of testing apart from other approaches that aim to achieve the same thing is that each system
  can be tested independently from the other and that the contract is generated by the code itself, meaning the
  contract is always kept up to date.

<p>One of the tools mostly used for contract testing is Pactflow</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fast:</strong> Contract tests run fast and are not reliant on other systems Easy to maintain</li>
  <li><strong>Early Detection of Integration Issues:</strong> Contracts verify consumerâ€“provider expectations before
    full integration, catching mismatches early in development.</li>
  <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> The contracts serve as living documentation of the API behavior, reducing
    miscommunication between teams.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Shared Ownership Challenges:</strong> Both producer and consumer teams must agree on contract changes,
    requiring strong collaboration.</li>
  <li><strong>False Sense of Security:</strong> Teams might over-rely on contract tests and neglect other types of
    testing (like integration or E2E), leading to gaps in quality.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Contract Testing is a great addition to any project that deals with large-scale and highly distributed
  applications. Integration issues between consumers and providers can be detected early without the need for
  setting up expensive integration environments. We would definitely recommend assessing contract testing as a
  technique.
