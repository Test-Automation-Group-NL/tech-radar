<h4>Description:</h4>
<p>
  Contract testing is a methodology for ensuring that two separate systems (such as two microservices) are compatible
  and can communicate with one another. It captures the interactions that are exchanged between each service, storing
  them in a contract, which can then be used to verify that both parties adhere to it. Contract testing goes beyond
  schema testing, requiring both parties to come to a consensus on the allowed set of interactions and allowing for
  evolution over time.<br />
  What sets this form of testing apart from other approaches that aim to achieve the same goal is that each system
  can be tested independently from the other, and the contract is generated by the code itself, meaning the
  contract is always kept up to date.

  One of the tools most commonly used for contract testing is Pactflow.

<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fast:</strong> Contract tests run quickly, are not reliant on other systems, and are easy to maintain.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Contracts must be shared between the producer and the consumer.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
  Contract testing is a great addition to any project that deals with large-scale and highly distributed
  applications. Integration issues between consumers and providers can be detected early without the need for
  setting up expensive integration environments. We definitely recommend assessing contract testing as a
  technique.
