<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Contract testing is a methodology for ensuring that two separate systems (such as two microservices) are compatible
    and can communicate with one another. It captures the interactions that are exchanged between each service, storing
    them in a contract, which then can be used to verify that both parties adhere to it. Contract testing goes beyond
    schema testing, requiring both parties to come to a consensus on the allowed set of interactions and allowing for
    evolution over time.
</p>
<p>
    What sets this form of testing apart from other approaches that aim to achieve the same thing is that each system
    can be tested independently from the other and that the contract is generated by the code itself, meaning the
    contract is always kept up to date.
</p>
<p>One of the tools mostly used for contract testing is Pactflow</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Fast</strong> Contract tests run fast and are not reliant on other systems Easy to maintain</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<li><strong>Sharing:</strong> Contracts have to be shared between producer and consumer</li>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Contract Testing is a great addition to any project that deals with large-scale and highly distributed
    application(s). Integration issues between consumers and providers can be detected early without the need for
    setting up expensive integration environments. We would definitely recommend assessing contract testing as a
    technique.</p>
