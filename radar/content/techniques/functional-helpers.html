<h4>Description</h4>
<p>
    Functional helpers are a lightweight approach to interacting with web page elements in automated tests. Rather than
    abstracting interactions through page object classes, functional helpers use standalone functions to perform actions
    directly on the page (e.g., clicking buttons, filling out forms). This approach capitalizes on the composability of
    modern testing frameworks like Playwright and Cypress, where you directly call functions that interact with
    elements.
    While this approach offers a simpler structure compared to Page Object Models (POM), it can quickly lead to tests
    that lack clear structure and organization, especially in larger applications. Without careful management,
    functional helpers can lead to a lack of separation of concerns, where the test logic becomes tightly coupled with
    how the page is interacted with, making tests harder to read and maintain.
</p>
<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Functional helpers focus on straightforward, easy-to-understand functions that
        interact directly with elements, reducing the need for complex abstractions like base page classes.</li>
    <li><strong>Better Debugging:</strong> Since functional helpers are simple and typically self-contained, they are
        easier to debug. Test failures can be traced directly to the helper function without needing to navigate through
        multiple layers of abstraction.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexibility and Reusability:</strong> Tests become more flexible because functional helpers allow for
        easy composition and reuse of actions across different scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Harder to Read and Maintain:</strong> One of the key challenges with functional helpers is that they
        often lack clear separation of concerns. In large tests, this can make it difficult to distinguish between what
        you're testing (business logic) and how you're interacting with the page (UI logic). This overlap can make tests
        harder to read, especially when tests grow in complexity.</li>
    <li><strong>Lack of Structure and Organization:</strong> In larger applications, functional helpers might lead to
        disorganized code. While functional helpers might be effective for small, isolated tests, when tests begin to
        scale, the lack of a cohesive structure may lead to repetition, lack of context, and difficulty in understanding
        test scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Potential for Code Duplication:</strong> Without a clear abstraction layer like POM, it's easy for
        helper functions to be duplicated across tests. Rewriting the same interactions for different tests can increase
        maintenance overhead, as changes to these actions must be made across multiple places in the codebase.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>
    Functional helpers may be an appealing choice for applications that heavily rely om UI components, where their
    lightweight and flexible nature can improve readability and speed of development. In larger applications or where
    tests become more complex, the lack of clear structure and separation of concerns can lead to maintainability
    challenges. The coupling of test logic and interaction logic might make tests more difficult to read, especially
    when working with large teams or scaling the test suite. In these cases, more structured approaches Page Object
    Models (POM), combined with composition, may be a better fit to keep tests readable and maintainable in the long
    term. Both POM and Functional Helpers can be excellent choices for your automation framework.
