<H4>Description:</H4>
<p>Playwright, released in January 2020, has quickly established itself as a strong alternative to tools like Cypress.
  It supports all major browser engines (Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox), operating systems, and programming languages.
  What sets Playwright apart are its automatic waiting features, actionability checks, and web-first assertions, making
  it a highly reliable tool for end-to-end (E2E) testing. Playwright also supports testing on real, unmodified browsers,
  including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, though with some feature limitations.</p>
<H4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Actionability checks:</strong> Ensure elements are actionable (e.g., visible, attached to the DOM) before
    interactions, significantly reducing flaky tests.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Web first assertions</strong> Automatically retries assertions until conditions are met, minimizing test
    failures due to timing issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Features for Debugging and Testing:</strong> Includes powerful tools like network interception, mocking, and
    tracing, giving developers granular control over their tests.
  </li>
</ul>
<H4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Proprietary Protocol:</strong> Playwright uses a proprietary protocol for its enhanced features, relying on
    modified browser engines. While it supports real browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, features such as
    network interception may not work fully with these unmodified browsers. Additionally, for Safari, Playwright relies
    on the WebKit engine rather than testing the real, unmodified Safari browser, which may lead to minor
    inconsistencies in Safari-specific environments.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Open Source Uncertainty:</strong> While excellent for E2E testing, its support for component testing is not
    as mature as some alternatives.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Limited Component Testing Support:</strong> Although open to contributions, Playwright is developed and
    controlled by
    Microsoft, making its future subject to corporate decisions.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
<p>Playwright is an excellent contender for E2E style tests with its automatic waiting capabilities and web-first
  assertions as well as network interception, mocking, and tracing capabilities Its ability to support both real
  browsers (e.g., Chrome and Edge) and modified engines provides flexibility for testing needs. However, its reliance on
  a proprietary protocol, including the use of WebKit for Safari-like testing, introduces some limitations when aiming
  for true browser fidelity. Additionally, while Playwright is open source, its development is controlled by Microsoft,
  meaning its long-term future is tied to corporate priorities.</p>
<p>Despite these trade-offs, Playwrightâ€™s rich feature set, reliability, and active development make it a strong
  contender for modern cross-browser automation. We strongly recommend Playwright for teams looking for a versatile and
  robust component testing / E2E testing framework.
